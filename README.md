# COVID19 Classification Interpretability

<p align="justify">
This project aims to provide interpretability for CNNs mainly through
visualizations, in the context of COVID-19 classifiaction using X-ray images.
More specifically a dataset of chest X-ray (CXR) images from Kaggle is considered for
COVID-19 positive cases along with Normal and Viral Pneumonia images and
use CNN model to perform the classification on these three classes. Then interpretability techniques are applied to learn why the model came up with its classification
decisions.
